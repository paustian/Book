This is the Book module for the zikula cms. It allows the handling of large structured
sets of documents into Books, Chapters and Articles. There is lots of functionality in 
this module and at some point I really need to write some documentation for it. 

##Version 5.0
This version is compatible with Zikula 3.0.0 and greater. It is now in RC1 state and 
should work in production sites. More testing is needed, but let me know 
if you have an issues by posting issues at [github](https://github.com/paustian/BookModule/issues)

##Version 3.0
Fixed modurl calls
Fixed PnRedirect calls
Fixed LogUtil calls
Fixed SessionUtil::setVar for status message, use addStatusPopup instead
