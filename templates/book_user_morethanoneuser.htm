<p>{gt text="There was a problem with your username in that two separate individuals were trying to use the same user account to read the book at the same time. This can only occur if you have shared your username and password with another student. You have been logged out of the book and can log back in when the other reader has finished their session. You were notified of this limitation in the end user agreement when you signed up for the subscription. Please do not share user accounts."}</p>
