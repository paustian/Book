This is the Book module for the zikula cms. It allows the handling of large structured
sets of documents into Books, Chapters and Articles. There is lots of functionality in 
this module and at some point I really need to write some documentation for it. 

Version 3.0
Fixed modurl calls
Fixed PnRedirect calls
Fixed LogUtil calls
Fixed SessionUtil::setVar for status message, use addStatusPopup instead

Verion 4.0 
Adds further integration with Symphony, fontawesome, and JQuery. This sports a much cleaner interface for manipulaitng documents.
