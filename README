This is the Book module for the zikula cms. It allows the handling of large structured
sets of documents into Books, Chapters and Articles. There is lots of functionality in 
this module and at some point I really need to write some documentation for it. 

##Version 5.0
This version is compatible with Zikula 3.0.0 and greater.
It is currently a work in progress, but I hope to have it functional soon 

Version 3.0
Fixed modurl calls
Fixed PnRedirect calls
Fixed LogUtil calls
Fixed SessionUtil::setVar for status message, use addStatusPopup instead
